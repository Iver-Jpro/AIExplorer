The scene depicts a person standing on the grey, dusty surface of the Moon's Sea of Tranquility. In front of them is Moonbase Bravo, a sprawling complex of interconnected modules and habitats. The base's solar panels and radiators gleam in the sunlight, while rovers and drones hum around the perimeter. The sky is always black, with stars and Earth visible in the distance, and the air is thin and dry.
